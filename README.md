# Web-Defender

The vulnerability scanner and web interface scripts you've provided are designed to work together in a web application security context. Here's a description of how they work together:

# Vulnerability Scanner:

The vulnerability scanner script is responsible for scanning a given URL for common vulnerabilities.
It sends an HTTP GET request to the specified URL and analyzes the response to identify potential vulnerabilities.
The script uses the requests library to send HTTP requests and the beautifulsoup4 library to parse the HTML content.
The script checks for vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, weak authentication, weak password policies, clickjacking, and missing security headers.

# Web Interface:

The web interface script is a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the vulnerability scanner.
It provides a form for users to enter the URL they want to scan.
When the form is submitted, the script calls the scan_vulnerabilities function from the vulnerability scanner script and passes the URL.
The results of the vulnerability scan are displayed on the interface.

# Integration:

The web interface script imports the scan_vulnerabilities function from the vulnerability scanner script.
When the user submits the URL in the form, the script calls the scan_vulnerabilities function and passes the URL as an argument.
The scan_vulnerabilities function performs the vulnerability scanning and returns the identified vulnerabilities.
The web interface script then renders the results on the HTML page.
This integration allows users to easily scan web applications for security vulnerabilities using the web interface, which provides a convenient and user-friendly experience.



# usage
Here's an example of how you can run the combined script (web_interface.py) and the output you might expect:


    python web-defender.py

This command will start the Flask web server, and you can access the web interface by navigating to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

On the web interface, you will see a form where you can enter the URL you want to scan. After entering the URL and clicking the "Scan" button, the script will call the scan_vulnerabilities function from the vulnerability scanner script and display the results on the page.

# output:

    XSS vulnerability found in the URL: https://example.com
    SQL injection vulnerability found in the URL: https://example.com
    Missing security header: X-Frame-Options in the URL: https://example.com


This output indicates that the scanner has identified potential XSS vulnerabilities, SQL injection vulnerabilities, and a missing security header (X-Frame-Options) in the scanned URL.

Remember, this is a basic example and the actual output may vary depending on the specific vulnerabilities found in the scanned URL.

You can enhance the web interface further by adding more features, error handling, and user-friendly messages. Additionally, you can integrate the vulnerability scanner script into a larger web application or security toolset for more comprehensive security testing.
